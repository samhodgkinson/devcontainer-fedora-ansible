# docker-ansible-image

This is a docker image is taken from the base image [docker-ubuntu2004-ansible](https://github.com/geerlingguy/docker-ubuntu2004-ansible) created by **gerrlingguy**.

With this image I'm hoping to provide a containerised environment that allows from testing and understanding Ansible better, along with allow testing and execution of playbooks with CI pipelines.

## DevContainer
